TO DO:

[X] reduce magical auto clicker speed
[X] add duck nest enhancement
[X] add strong cursor enhancement
[ ] make reinforced clicker increase DPC by percentage
[ ] make duck coop increase DPS by percentage
[ ] add cursor size enhancement
[ ] add more DPS enhancements


ANALYSIS:

2/3/26 - Tested the game for 25 minutes, noticed magical auto clickers 
were far too fast for how cheap they were, making manual duck clicking
not needed. The strong cursor and duck nest upgrades became obsolete 
after buying some enhancements, since they increased DPS and DPC
drastically, which isnt exactly a problem, since I want them to be 
powerful, but those enhancements made the strstrong cursor and duck 
nest upgrades useless when buying. Enhancements were a little too 
expensive as well, mostly after Radiant Plunge(I) enhancement, 
though its likely I didnt test long enough.
