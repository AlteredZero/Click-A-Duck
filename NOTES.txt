ANALYSIS:

2/10/26 - I tested the game for 35 minutes, and a lot has changed. Compared
to the last test, this time I was able to buy all enhancements and gained 
ducks much faster, which is a good thing, since with the previous test,
after just 25 minutes, I was only able to buy a total of maybe 6 
enhancements. The shiny duck is the main reason for such earnings,
since they gave incredible boosts, but they appear WAY too often.
It appeared really commonly, I mean I would say 3 shiny ducks in the pool
at once, even though it has a 0.02% of spawning. Its somewhat ridiculous.
I also noticed the imbalance of value, somtimes some upgrades and 
enhancements were unfair, and other times they were far too over powered.
Duck per second overall needs a nerd, I mean at least 30% of the game,
duck per second earned nearly as much as duck per click, which made
actively playing the game obsolete, which I want to avoid. Overall though,
apart from those issues, the progression felt nice, and 10% price scaling
is a good amount, compared to 15%. I am fairly satisfied with the current
progress, though the shiny ducks really made it hard to truly know the
progression.


2/3/26 - Tested the game for 25 minutes, noticed magical auto clickers 
were far too fast for how cheap they were, making manual duck clicking
not needed. The strong cursor and duck nest upgrades became obsolete 
after buying some enhancements, since they increased DPS and DPC
drastically, which isnt exactly a problem, since I want them to be 
powerful, but those enhancements made the strstrong cursor and duck 
nest upgrades useless when buying. Enhancements were a little too 
expensive as well, mostly after Radiant Plunge(I) enhancement, 
though its likely I didnt test long enough.
